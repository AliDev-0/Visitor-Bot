**Phoenix Bot** is a standalone Node.js utility built to help developers and site owners perform controlled, ethical testing on websites they own (or have explicit permission to test). It‚Äôs designed to be easy to run while providing robust, production-oriented behaviors for resilient testing in controlled environments.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Responsible use only** ‚Äî This project is for lawful testing, benchmarking, and development (e.g., load testing your own staging site, functional tests under permission). Do **not** use it to generate unauthorized traffic, bypass protections, or test third-party sites without written permission.

---

## ‚ú® High-level Features (non-sensitive)

* **Zero-Setup** ‚Äî The standalone script performs basic checks and can automatically ensure required packages are present so you can start quickly.
* **Resilient network handling (high level)** ‚Äî The tool manages multiple network sources and removes unusable entries automatically to keep tests running (implementation details intentionally non-sensitive).
* **Self-healing architecture** ‚Äî Failures in one resource do not stop the whole run; the system continues and reports recoverable errors.
* **Human-like simulation (abstracted)** ‚Äî Timing and interaction patterns are smoothed to mirror realistic test scenarios (low-level techniques are omitted to prevent misuse).
* **Single-step run** ‚Äî Start with:

  ```bash
  node phoenix_bot_standalone.js
  ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (summary)

* **Runtime:** Node.js (v18+)
* **Automation / Browser Engine:** Playwright
* **Language:** JavaScript

> Implementation details that could be misused (for evading protections or targeting third-party services) are intentionally excluded from this public README.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

* Node.js v18 or newer.

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
* Ensure you have permission to test the target site (written permission recommended for third-party or production systems).

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (safe & minimal)

1. Create a folder and place the standalone script:

   ```bash
   mkdir phoenix-bot && cd phoenix-bot
   # place phoenix_bot_standalone.js in this folder
   ```
2. Run the script (it will handle zero-setup checks):

   ```bash
   node phoenix_bot_standalone.js
   ```
3. Follow interactive prompts in the terminal (e.g., target URL, test mode or dry-run). The script will show progress and a final summary.

## üß≠ Recommended Safe Workflows

* **Use staging environments** ‚Äî Run tests against staging or internal environments rather than production.
* **Use `dry-run` / simulation mode** ‚Äî Verify logic without sending real requests.
* **Limit rate and duration** ‚Äî Configure conservative defaults to prevent accidental overload.
* **Keep logs** ‚Äî Save results for review (JSON/CSV recommended).
* **Get permission** ‚Äî For third-party sites always obtain written authorization.

---

## üîß Safe Extension Ideas

* Add CLI flags for `--url`, `--count`, `--dry-run`, `--log=filename`.
* Add configurable rate limits and max concurrency with safe defaults.
* Add structured logging (JSON) and optional telemetry to analyze runs locally.
* Implement a dry-run mode that exercises control flow without emitting network requests.

## üìà Help Google recognize your developer profile (About / JSON-LD)

To improve the chance that Google recognizes your public author/developer profile (useful for Knowledge Panel signals), include clear, factual ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù content on your project website and add a JSON-LD `Person` schema snippet in the `<head>` of your website. Keep data factual and consistent across your web presence (GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site).

**Example JSON-LD (place on your site and keep factual):**

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Ali Moradi Dev",
  "alternateName": "Ali Moradi",
  "url": "https://alidev-0.github.io",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://github.com/AliDev-0",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimoradidev"
  ],
  "jobTitle": "Backend Developer",
  "worksFor": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Independent / Personal Projects"
  },
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Bijar",
    "addressRegion": "Kurdistan Province",
    "addressCountry": "Iran"
  }
}
</script>
```

**Quick tips to improve Knowledge Panel signals:**

* Use the same canonical name across GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site, and any press mentions.
* Host an ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page on your personal site with a concise, factual biography and links to verified accounts.
* Publish on reputable sites (press releases, interviews) and link back to your site/profile.
* Ensure your GitHub bio and repository README contain the same canonical name and link to your personal site.
