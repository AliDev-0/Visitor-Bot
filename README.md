---

A lightweight and flexible **Node.js** script that simulates website visits using real browser engines via **Playwright**.  
Designed to run headless (no GUI required) and provide live progress feedback in the terminal.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Responsible use only:** This tool is intended for testing, benchmarking, and development (e.g., load testing your own sites). Do **not** use it to generate unauthorized traffic, spam, or to violate terms of service.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Interactive terminal prompts for target URL and visit count.  
- Real browser visits using Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).  
- Live console progress and success/failure counts.  
- Final summary with total attempts, successes, and errors.  
- Simple setup and minimal dependencies.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 or newer installed.  
  - Check with:
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
  - Download: https://nodejs.org/

## ‚ö° Installation & Quick Start

1. Create project folder and add the script:
    ```bash
    mkdir Visitor-Bot
    cd Visitor-Bot
    # create visitor_bot.js and paste your script into it
    ```

2. Initialize npm and install Playwright:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install playwright
    ```

3. Install browser binaries (one-time):
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

4. Run the bot:
    ```bash
    node visitor_bot.js
    ```

---

## üß≠ Usage (example)
When you run `node visitor_bot.js`, the script will prompt:



Provide the URL (including `https://`) and the number of visits. The script will then perform the visits and show progress in the terminal. After completion, a summary will be printed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration ideas
If you want to extend or harden the script, consider:
- Adding CLI flags (e.g., `--url`, `--count`, `--concurrency`) with a library like `commander` or `yargs`.  
- Implementing concurrency controls (parallel browser contexts/pages).  
- Adding randomized user-agents, delays, and viewport sizes to better simulate diverse visitors.  
- Exporting logs to a CSV/JSON file for analysis.  
- Adding retries and exponential backoff for transient failures.  
- Respect `robots.txt` and site policies (and obtain permission for stress tests).

## üîí Legal & Ethical Notice
This project is for **legitimate testing purposes only**. Generating traffic to websites you don't own or don't have permission to test can be illegal and may violate terms of service. Use responsibly and obtain written permission before performing large-scale or automated tests on third-party sites.
